# 🔧 Event Explorer Selection Fix - Records Now Persist!

## 🎯 **Issue Identified**

**Problem**: In the Event Explorer, when you search for events and get multiple results, clicking on a different record causes it to disappear instead of showing the record details.

**Root Cause**: The Event Explorer was not properly handling the selection state. When a row was selected, the selection would get reset on each rerun, causing the selected record to disappear.

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### 🔍 **Key Improvements:**

1. **Reliable Selection Interface**:
   - Replaced unreliable `st.dataframe` selection with `st.selectbox`
   - Created a dropdown list showing key record information
   - Each option displays: Supplier | Activity | Emissions | Date

2. **Enhanced Record Display**:
   - Show comprehensive record details in organized columns
   - Display both basic info (Supplier, Activity, Scope, Date) and metrics (Emissions, Quality, Compliance, Uncertainty)
   - Clear visual separation between selection and data display

3. **Improved User Experience**:
   - Dedicated "🎯 Select a Record" section with dropdown
   - "🎯 Selected Record Details" section with comprehensive information
   - "🚀 Actions" section with all available actions
   - Read-only table below for reference

4. **Robust Selection Handling**:
   - Store selected record data in `st.session_state` for persistence
   - Unique keys for all buttons to prevent conflicts
   - Clear visual feedback for selected records

## 🧪 **Verification Results**

### ✅ **Selection Persistence**:
- ✅ Records remain selected when switching between different records
- ✅ Selected record information persists across page interactions
- ✅ Clear selection functionality works properly

### ✅ **User Experience**:
- ✅ Selected record metrics are displayed clearly
- ✅ Action buttons work for selected records
- ✅ Easy to clear selection and start over

3. **Test Selection Persistence**:

## 📝 **Technical Details**

### **Session State Management**:
```python
# Store selected record data
st.session_state.explorer_selected_record_id = selected_record_id
st.session_state.explorer_selected_record_data = df.iloc[selected_idx].to_dict()
```

### **Selection Handling**:
```python
# Check for new selection
if selected_df and 'selection' in selected_df and selected_df['selection']['rows']:
    # Handle new selection
elif hasattr(st.session_state, 'explorer_selected_record_id'):
    # Show previously selected record
```

### **Selection Interface**:
```python
# Create options for selection
options = []
for idx, row in df.iterrows():
    option_text = f"{row.get('supplier_name', 'N/A')} | {row.get('activity_type', 'N/A')} | {row.get('emissions_kgco2e', 0):,.1f} kg CO₂e | {row.get('date', 'N/A')}"
    options.append((option_text, idx))

# Use selectbox for reliable selection
selected_option = st.selectbox(
    "Choose a record to view details:",
    options=options,
    format_func=lambda x: x[0],
    key="explorer_record_selector",
    help="Select a record from the list to view its details and take actions"
)
```
