# 🔍 Event Details Selection Fix - No More Page Refreshes!

## 🎯 **Issue Identified**

**Problem**: When clicking on other options from the same supplier in the Event Details page, the page was refreshing instead of showing the new record details. Users couldn't smoothly switch between different records from the same search results.

**Root Cause**: The search results were being regenerated on every page load, and the session state wasn't properly maintaining the selected record index when switching between options.

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### 🔧 **Enhanced Session State Management:**

1. **Persistent Search Results**: 
   - Search results are now stored in `st.session_state['details_search_results']`
   - Record IDs are stored in `st.session_state['details_record_ids']`
   - This prevents regeneration of search results on every page load

2. **Smart Selection Handling**:
   - Current selection is maintained in `st.session_state['details_record_selection']`
   - When selection changes, session state is updated and page reruns
   - Selection index is validated to prevent out-of-bounds errors

3. **Improved Clear Functionality**:
   - "Clear" button now properly clears all search-related session state
   - "Back to Search" button already had proper clearing logic

### 🧪 **How the Fix Works:**

1. **First Search**: 
   - User searches for records (e.g., by supplier)
   - Results are stored in session state
   - User can select any record from the dropdown

2. **Switching Records**:
   - User changes selection in the dropdown
   - Session state is updated with new selection index
   - Page reruns and shows new record details
   - **No more page refresh issues!**

3. **Persistent Results**:
   - Search results remain available until user performs new search or clears
   - User can switch between records without losing search context

## 🚀 **Technical Implementation**

### **Enhanced Search Results Handling**:
```python
# Store search results in session state to prevent regeneration
st.session_state['details_search_results'] = results
st.session_state['details_record_ids'] = ids

# Get current selection from session state or default to 0
current_selection = st.session_state.get('details_record_selection', 0)
if current_selection >= len(display_options):
    current_selection = 0

selected_idx = st.selectbox(
    "Select a record to view details:",
    range(len(display_options)),
    index=current_selection,
    format_func=lambda x: display_options[x],
    key="details_record_selection_new"
)

# Update session state when selection changes
if selected_idx != current_selection:
    st.session_state['details_record_selection'] = selected_idx
    st.rerun()
```

### **Persistent Results Logic**:
```python
# Check if we have existing search results in session state
if 'details_search_results' in st.session_state and not search:
    results = st.session_state['details_search_results']
```

### **Enhanced Clear Functionality**:
```python
if clear_search:
    # Clear session state and rerun to reset the form
    if 'details_record_selection' in st.session_state:
        del st.session_state['details_record_selection']
    if 'details_search_results' in st.session_state:
        del st.session_state['details_search_results']
    if 'details_record_ids' in st.session_state:
        del st.session_state['details_record_ids']
    st.rerun()
```
