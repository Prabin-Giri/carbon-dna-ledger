# 🔧 Event Explorer Selection - Button-Based Approach!

## 🎯 **Issue Identified**

**Problem**: The Event Explorer selection was still not working properly even after trying selectbox and radio buttons.

**Root Cause**: Streamlit's selection widgets (selectbox, radio) can be unreliable in certain contexts, especially with complex data structures.

## ✅ **New Solution Implemented**

### 🔍 **Button-Based Selection Approach:**

1. **Individual Record Buttons**:
   - Each record is displayed as a separate row with its own "Select" and "View" buttons
   - No complex selection widgets - just simple buttons that work reliably
   - Each button has a unique key based on the record index

2. **Immediate Selection**:
   - When a button is clicked, the record is immediately selected and stored in session state
   - Uses `st.rerun()` to refresh the page and show the selected record details
   - No complex state management - just direct button-to-selection mapping

3. **Clear Visual Layout**:
   - Each record shows: **Supplier** | Activity | Emissions | Date
   - Two buttons per record: "Select" and "View"
   - Clear dividers between records
   - Selected record details appear below the list

## 🧪 **How to Test the New Fix**

1. **Navigate to Event Explorer**: http://127.0.0.1:8501 → "🔍 Event Explorer"
2. **Search for records** (you should get multiple results)
3. **See the new interface**:
   - Each record is displayed as a separate row
   - Each row has "Select" and "View" buttons
   - Click either button to select a record
4. **Check the results**:
   - Debug information shows the selected record ID
   - "🎯 Selected Record Details" section appears
   - Record information is displayed in two columns
   - Action buttons are available

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior**

**Before Fix**: ❌ Selection widgets not working reliably
**After Fix**: ✅ 
- Each record has its own selectable buttons
- Clicking any button immediately selects that record
- Selected record details are displayed clearly
- All action buttons work properly
- No complex selection state management

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### **Button-Based Selection Logic**:
```python
# Show records as individual selectable items
for idx, row in df.iterrows():
    record_id = row['id']
    supplier = row.get('supplier_name', 'N/A')
    activity = row.get('activity_type', 'N/A')
    emissions = row.get('emissions_kgco2e', 0)
    date = row.get('date', 'N/A')
    
    # Create a container for each record
    with st.container():
        col1, col2, col3 = st.columns([3, 1, 1])
        
        with col1:
            st.write(f"**{supplier}** | {activity} | {emissions:,.1f} kg CO₂e | {date}")
        
        with col2:
            if st.button("Select", key=f"select_btn_{idx}"):
                # Store selected record in session state
                st.session_state.explorer_selected_record_id = record_id
                st.session_state.explorer_selected_record_data = row.to_dict()
                st.rerun()
        
        with col3:
            if st.button("View", key=f"view_btn_{idx}"):
                # Store selected record in session state
                st.session_state.explorer_selected_record_id = record_id
                st.session_state.explorer_selected_record_data = row.to_dict()
                st.rerun()
        
        st.divider()
```

### **Session State Management**:
```python
# Show selected record details if one is selected
if hasattr(st.session_state, 'explorer_selected_record_id') and st.session_state.explorer_selected_record_id:
    selected_record = st.session_state.explorer_selected_record_data
    # Display record details and action buttons
```
