# 🏠 Back to Search Button - Fixed!

## 🎯 **Issue Identified**

**Problem**: The "Back to Search" button in the Event Details page was not working properly. When clicked, it wasn't clearing all the necessary session state variables, so users couldn't return to the search interface.

**Root Cause**: The button was only clearing `details_record_selection` but not other session state variables like `selected_record_id` (from Event Explorer) and related search state variables.

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### 🔧 **Enhanced Session State Clearing:**

The "Back to Search" button now clears **all relevant session state variables**:

1. **Event Details Session State**:
   - `details_record_selection` - Selected record index from search results
   - `details_search_results` - Search results data
   - `details_record_ids` - Record IDs from search results

2. **Event Explorer Session State**:
   - `selected_record_id` - Record ID passed from Event Explorer
   - `explorer_selected_record_id` - Selected record ID in Event Explorer
   - `explorer_selected_record_data` - Selected record data in Event Explorer

3. **Complete Reset**:
   - All session state variables are properly cleared
   - `st.rerun()` is called to refresh the page
   - User is returned to the clean search interface

## 🧪 **How to Test the Fix**

1. **Navigate to Event Details**: 
   - Go to "🧬 Event Details" page
   - Either search for a record or come from Event Explorer

2. **View Record Details**:
   - A record should be displayed with all its details
   - You should see the action buttons at the bottom

3. **Click "Back to Search"**:
   - Click the "🏠 Back to Search" button
   - The page should refresh and show the search interface
   - All previous selections should be cleared

4. **Verify Clean State**:
   - Search fields should be empty
   - No record should be pre-selected
   - You should see "Search for a record by external_id, supplier, date, or description."

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior**

**Before Fix**: ❌ 
- "Back to Search" button didn't work properly
- Session state wasn't fully cleared
- Users couldn't return to search interface

**After Fix**: ✅ 
- "Back to Search" button works perfectly
- All session state is properly cleared
- Users can return to clean search interface
- Works from both direct search and Event Explorer navigation

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### **Enhanced Button Implementation**:
```python
if st.button("🏠 Back to Search", help="Return to record search"):
    # Clear all session state related to record selection
    if 'details_record_selection' in st.session_state:
        del st.session_state['details_record_selection']
    if 'selected_record_id' in st.session_state:
        del st.session_state['selected_record_id']
    if 'details_search_results' in st.session_state:
        del st.session_state['details_search_results']
    if 'details_record_ids' in st.session_state:
        del st.session_state['details_record_ids']
    # Also clear Event Explorer session state
    if 'explorer_selected_record_id' in st.session_state:
        del st.session_state['explorer_selected_record_id']
    if 'explorer_selected_record_data' in st.session_state:
        del st.session_state['explorer_selected_record_data']
    st.rerun()
```

### **Session State Variables Cleared**:
- **`details_record_selection`**: Selected record index from search results
- **`selected_record_id`**: Record ID passed from Event Explorer
- **`details_search_results`**: Search results data
- **`details_record_ids`**: Record IDs from search results
- **`explorer_selected_record_id`**: Selected record ID in Event Explorer
